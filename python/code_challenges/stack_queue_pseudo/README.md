# Challenge Summary
Implement a Queue using two Stacks

## Whiteboard Process
![stack queue pesudo](stack-queue-pseudo.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
I use class to implement the pesudoQueue ,for the enqueue I push the value to the stack and in the dequeue I pop the values from the first stack to the second one ,then I pop the value from the second stack and stored it into variable ,then I returned the value again to first stack

## Solution
Navegate to `python/code_challenge/stack_queue_pesudo` then open the termenal and run `poetry shell` then pytest the `stack_queue_pesudo`
